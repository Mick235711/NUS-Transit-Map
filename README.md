# NUS-Transit-Map
A map on all the public transportation lines available in the National University of Singapore (NUS) region

## How to use?
Well, the official ISB map is available [at the UCI website](https://uci.nus.edu.sg/oca/transport-logistics-carpark/getting-around-nus/). The main changes I have done is as follows:
- Redesign all the lines' trace such that it looks better
- Combine opposite station pairs into one (read the note for identify both names)
- Add 95/96/151 SBST/TTS buses, since they pass through NUS and is frequently used by students
- Add pointers to nearest department, bus numbers, etc.
- Add a schedule/interval flowchart

The latest version is available in the file `NUS ISB Map Full.jpg`. Feel free to suggest and/or point out problems by creating an issue!
